# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Linear and Lasso Regression

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as year, present price, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and more. Two models are implemented and compared: **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `car data.csv`, which contains information about cars such as:

- **Year**
- **Present_Price**
- **Kms_Driven**
- **Fuel_Type**
- **Seller_Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Owner**
- **Selling_Price**

---

## 📌 Objective

- Preprocess and visualize the dataset.
- Train a Linear Regression model.
- Train a Lasso Regression model.
- Compare both models on performance metrics.
- Predict car prices using the trained models.

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for regression models)

---

## 📈 Model Implementation

### ✅ Linear Regression:
A traditional model that minimizes the sum of squared errors. Useful as a baseline model.

### ✅ Lasso Regression:
A regularized version of Linear Regression that performs L1 regularization to reduce overfitting and select important features.

---

## 🚀 Results

- Visualizations show the relation between features and the target variable.
- Model evaluation includes metrics like **R² score**, **MAE**, and **MSE**.
- Lasso Regression helps in feature selection and reduces complexity.
